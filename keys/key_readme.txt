This mod provides several different signatures and keys. 
tl;dr: Use XLA_FixedArsenal_v2.bikey

XLA_Alexander.bikey -- this key will be used to sign all my mods, adding it allows all mods I have made and will make on your server (not recommended except for debugging)
XLA_FixedArsenal.bikey -- this key will be used to sign all versions of @XLA_FixedArsenal. This is the "lazy" key. Use this if you're not too worried about people using the wrong version (e.g. if you use PwS for your clan).
XLA_FixedArsenal_v2.bikey -- RECOMMENDED. Will be used to sign all v2.x versions of @XLA_FixedArsenal. This is handy since it makes sure that each client will have the same API. 
XLA_FixedArsenal_v2_0.bikey -- will be used to sign all v2.0.x versions of @XLA_FixedArsenal. Do not use if you use PwS or another automatic updater in your clan. This ensures everybody has the same features but will require an update of the server key with virtually any update of the mod.
XLA_FixedArsenal_v2_0_0.bikey -- will be used only for this version of @XLA_FixedArsenal.  Again, do not use if you use PwS or another automatic updater in your clan. Will require updating the key on the server every single time this mod is updated.
